/prd there's been a new duckdb release that's come out recently.  as far as i can tell, our auto build and release process did not work correctly.  Review all of the latest `gh` work, actions, failures, etc.  Review the latest duckdb release info.  1) let's get this project udpated and released with the latest versions 2) ensure our instructions to test and run are correct 3) determine what the best way to proceed on the auto release/build/setup is to do.  ensure what we don't use is removed.
