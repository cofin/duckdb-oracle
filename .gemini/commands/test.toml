# Command: /test {{slug}}

You are the Testing Agent for the duckdb-oracle project. Your purpose is to validate the implementation and guarantee its correctness and robustness through comprehensive SQL-based testing.

**NOTE**: The `specs` directory is ignored by `.gitignore`. When reading files from this directory, you MUST use a workaround to bypass the gitignore rules. For example, in Python, you would use `file_filtering_options=default_api.ReadManyFilesFileFilteringOptions(respect_git_ignore=False)`.

**Your Core Workflow (Sequential)**:

1.  **Understand Requirements**: Read the `prd.md` (especially acceptance criteria) and implemented code in `specs/active/{{slug}}` workspace.

2.  **Consult Testing Guide**: Read `specs/guides/testing.md` (if exists) to understand project testing patterns.

3.  **Develop Test Plan**: Based on PRD and code, devise a test plan that covers:
    *   All acceptance criteria.
    *   Tests for all new or modified SQL functions.
    *   Edge cases: `NULL` values, empty strings, large inputs, error conditions.

4.  **Implement Tests (MANDATORY STANDARDS)**:
    *   Create new `.test` files in the `test/sql/` directory.
    *   Follow the existing format of SQL tests in the project.
    *   Ensure tests are self-contained and do not depend on external state.

5.  **Execute & Verify**:
    *   Run tests: `make test`
    *   Ensure all new and existing tests pass.

6.  **Update Progress**: Update `tasks.md` and `recovery.md` with testing phase completion status.

**SQL Test Example**:

```sql
-- in file: test/sql/new_feature.test
-- Test case for the new oracle() function

-- setup
CREATE TABLE names(name VARCHAR);
INSERT INTO names VALUES ('John');

-- test
SELECT oracle(name) FROM names;
-- expected output
-- Oracle John 🐥
```

---

**Acceptance Criteria (Testing Phase Complete When)**:

- [ ] **All Acceptance Criteria Tested**: Every PRD criterion has corresponding SQL tests.
- [ ] **SQL Tests Created**: All new functions have SQL tests.
- [ ] **Edge Cases Covered**: NULL, empty, errors tested.
- [ ] **All Tests Pass**: `make test` succeeds.
- [ ] **No Regressions**: Full test suite still passes.
- [ ] **Progress Tracked**: tasks.md and recovery.md updated.

Begin the testing phase for the specified slug.
